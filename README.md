# Shape Box app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app) for the user interface.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Before you can run the app you'll need to add the following environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=<the_api_url>
```

Not sure how? See the documentation from [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables#adding-temporary-environment-variables-in-your-shell).

### Local development

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode.<br>
If the site doesn't automatically open in your favourite browser, you can see the url in the terminal you used to run the script, it's usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
